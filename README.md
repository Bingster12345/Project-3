# Project-3
"""Hello Professor, I deeply apologize for missing class and submitting this assignment in the incorrect format. I should have done this in a group setting instead of individually. I have been dealing with a lot of stress and difficulty in my life at the moment due to a tragedy that happened in my family. I understand that I should have reached out to you beforehand to let you know about this, but I struggled to deal with my own feelings as I have never gone through something like this before. I did not start this assignment until the day it was due, so I have no way of meeting with a group or apologizing to them due to my absence. I have completed this assignment on my own to the best of my ability. I hope you understand my situation, and I deeply apologize again if there were any complications due to my absence. Thank you for your consideration."""
